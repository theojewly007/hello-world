exploring the world like the first time

**My name is Theo**

I am a college student currently studying computer science. 
I have a deep passion for coding and enjoy exploring the endless possibilities of the digital world. 
With a curious mind and a love for problem-solving, I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. 
I believe that technology has the power to make a positive impact on society, and I am excited to be a part of this ever-evolving industry.
